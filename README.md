Predictive Modeling and Classification with Regression and KNN
Use linear/ridge regression models on 20,000+ housing records, optimizing model via alpha tuning to prevent overfitting.
Improved model accuracy through feature scaling, cross-validation, and MSE-based evaluation.
Built a KNN classifier to categorize 150+ iris samples across 3 species, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Visualized complex relationship with decision boundaries and confusion matrices to evaluate model precision and recall.
